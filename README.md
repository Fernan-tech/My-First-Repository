# My-First-Repository
This is the first repository. 

I've created this repository as an exercise for the graduate seminar.

## First step: Cloning a repository

After creating the repository, I dowload **GitHub Desktop**. This enables me to have a local version of the project in my computer, including all the files. To that end, I cloned the repository I had created previously.

## Second step: synchronize with remote repository

Now, I can make changes in my local version. However, I don't create a new version until committing these changes and **pushing** the repository. It is a way of synchronizing my repository remotely. I also can work on GitHub online and when I finish the activity, I **pull** the repository from GitHub Desktop to synchronize the local version.

# Introduction
***
My name is Fernando Romero. I am a Spanish PhD Student who is visiting McMaster. I expect to defend my thesis by the end of next year. I'm also studying a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration at the National Distance Education University in Spain. My research is on _**transport**_ and _**mobility**_. Since I was a child, I was keen on buses, subways and urban maps so I'm doing what I wanted to do.  I am interested in _**Data Science Applied to Transport Sector**_, _**Intelligent Transportation Systems**_, _**Urbanism**_ and _**Travel Behavior**_. Recent work includes studies on the impact of real-time information on route choice and how measures aimed at tackling high pollution episodes change commuter's behavior. Currently, I try to find out which transport demand management measures would foster a more sustainable mobility in a case study in Madrid. These measures include incentives for carpooling, improvements in bus travel time, or removing transfers at subway network.
