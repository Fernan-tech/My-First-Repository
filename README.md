# My-First-Repository
This is my first repositor.

I've created this repository as an exercise for the graduate seminar.

# Cloning a repository

Now that I hvae cloned this, I have a local version of the project, including all the files.

# Second step: sync with remote repository

I don't create a new version until I sync remote repository.
